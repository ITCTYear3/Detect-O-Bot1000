"Mars Rover" project for detecting magnetic material on the patrolling surface and marking found locations.

Rover is controlled wirelessly and moves using two front wheels attached to a platform with a swiveling back wheel.
Rover also has a webcam for a remote visual live feed which is attached to a pivoting gearbox controlled by a stepper motor.
Magnetic material detection is done using a detection coil, and the marking system utilizes a mechanical dispenser which can eject an acrylic disc at the detection site.
